 Lab 2: Diabetes Progression Prediction

 Author: Lohith Reddy Danda

1. Project Overview
This lab applies multiple supervised learning models to predict diabetes disease‑progression scores using the Scikit‑Learn diabetes dataset. Models include univariate polynomial regression, multivariate polynomial regression, decision tree regression, k‑nearest neighbors regression, and logistic regression for binary classification.

2. Repository Structure
notebooks/            # Lab2_Diabetes.ipynb
outputs/              # Saved figures or results
src/                  # Source folder (contains __init__.py)
requirements.txt
README.md

3. How to Run
- Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
- Open the notebook.
- Run all cells from top to bottom.
- Save the notebook after all outputs appear.
- Push the saved notebook to GitHub.

4. Ensuring Outputs Show on GitHub
GitHub only displays outputs that were already generated and saved in the notebook.
Run the entire notebook, confirm all plots and results are visible, save it, then push.

5. Methods Used
- Univariate polynomial regression (BMI only)
- Multivariate polynomial regression
- Decision tree regression
- k‑nearest neighbors regression
- Logistic regression (binary classification)

6. Evaluation
- Regression: R², MAE, MAPE
- Classification: accuracy, precision, recall, F1‑score
- Train–validation–test split for fair comparison

7. Requirements
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
seaborn
