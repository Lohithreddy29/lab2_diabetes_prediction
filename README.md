# Lab 2: Diabetes Progression Prediction

## 1. Project Overview
This lab applies multiple supervised learning models to predict diabetes disease‑progression scores using the Scikit‑Learn diabetes dataset.  
Models include:  
- Univariate polynomial regression  
- Multivariate polynomial regression  
- Decision tree regression  
- k-nearest neighbors regression  
- Logistic regression (binary classification)

## 3. How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Lab2_Diabetes.ipynb
```
3.Run all cells from top to bottom.

4.Save the notebook after all outputs appear.

5.Push the saved notebook to GitHub.

## 4. Ensuring Outputs Show on GitHub
GitHub only displays outputs that were already generated and saved in the notebook. To ensure everything appears correctly:

Run the entire notebook.

-Confirm all plots and results are visible.

-Save the notebook.

-Push it to GitHub.

## 5. Methods Used
-Univariate polynomial regression (BMI only)

-Multivariate polynomial regression

-Decision tree regression

-k-nearest neighbors regression

-Logistic regression (binary classification)

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
**Regression**: R², MAE, MAPE

**Classification**: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

**Validation Strategy**: train–validation–test split for fair comparison

## 7. Requirements

-numpy

-pandas

-matplotlib

-scikit-learn

-seaborn

## Author / Course

**Name**: Lohith Reddy Danda


-**Course**: Foundations of Machine Learning Frameworks

## 9. Outputs / Plots (Optional)

All plots and figures generated by the notebook can be saved in the outputs/ folder. Make sure to run the notebook and save the outputs before pushing to GitHub to ensure all visualizations appear correctly.
